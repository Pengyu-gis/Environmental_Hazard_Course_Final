### 1. *Land Cover & Green Infrastructure Assessment*
Evaluate the distribution and effectiveness of green spaces (parks, urban forests, wetlands) in Chester County, PA, and Howard County, MD.
- GEE Land Cover Classification: [Land Cover](GEE_Land_Cover.ipynb)
- GEE NDVI: [NDVI](GEE_NDVI.ipynb)

### 2. *Flood Risk Mapping*
For understanding which areas are more susceptible to flooding, allowing for better urban planning, disaster preparedness, and resource allocation.

### 3. *Socioeconomic Vulnerability Analysis*
Assess the vulnerability of populations based on socioeconomic factors to understand how communities may be impacted by hazards.
- Use U.S. Census Data to obtain socioeconomic indicators.
- Map vulnerability indicators such as poverty rates, unemployment, education levels, etc.
- Combine with hazard maps to identify at-risk communities.
